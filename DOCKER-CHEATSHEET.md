# Docker Cheat Sheet

### Lifecycle

* [`docker run`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#run) creates a container.
* [`docker stop`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#stop) stops it.
* [`docker start`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#start) will start it again.
* [`docker restart`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#restart) restarts a container.
* [`docker rm`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#rm) deletes a container.
* [`docker kill`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#kill) sends a SIGKILL to a container.  [Has issues](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/197).
* [`docker attach`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#attach) will connect to a running container.
* [`docker wait`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#wait) blocks until container stops.

If you want to run and then interact with a container, `docker start` then `docker attach` or, as of 0.9, `nsenter`.

You can find a copy of [nsenter here](https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter)

# Using nsenter

This is a small Docker recipe to build `nsenter` easily and install it in your
system.

### Entering a Docker Container

The "official" way to enter a docker container while it's running is to use `nsenter`, which uses [libcontainer under the hood](http://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/03/23/lxc-attach-nsinit-nsenter-docker-0-9/).  Using an `sshd` daemon is [considered evil](http://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/06/23/docker-ssh-considered-evil/).  

Unfortunately, nsenter requires some configuration and installation. If your operating system does not include nsenter (usually in a package named util-linux or similar, although it has to be quite a recent version), the easiest way is probably to install it through docker, as described in the first of the following links:

* [Installing nsenter using docker](https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter)
* [How to enter a Docker container](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/07/enter-docker-container/)
* [Docker debug with nsenter on boot2docker](http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/05/docker-debug-with-nsenter-on-boot2docker/)

`nsenter` allows you to run any command (e.g. a shell) inside a container that's already running another command (e.g. your database or webserver). This allows you to see all mounted volumes, check on processes, log files etc. inside a running container.

The first installation method described above also installs a small wrapper script wrapping `nsenter` named `docker-enter` that makes executing a shell inside a running container as easy as `docker-enter CONTAINER` and any other command via `docker-enter CONTAINER COMMAND`.


### What is `nsenter`?

It is a small tool allowing to `enter` into `n`ame`s`paces. Technically,
it can enter existing namespaces, or spawn a process into a new set of
namespaces. "What are those namespaces you're blabbering about?"
We are talking about [container namespaces].

`nsenter` can do many useful things, but the main reason why I'm so
excited about it is because it lets you [enter into a Docker container].


### Why build `nsenter` in a container?

This is because my preferred distros (Debian and Ubuntu) ship with an
outdated version of `util-linux` (the package that should contain `nsenter`).
Therefore, if you need `nsenter` on those distros, you have to juggle with
APT repository, or compile from source, orâ€¦ Ain't nobody got time for that.

I'm going to make a very bold assumption: if you landed here, it's because
you want to enter a Docker container. Therefore, you won't mind if my
method to build `nsenter` uses Docker itself.


### How do I install `nsenter` with this?

If you want to install `nsenter` into `/usr/local/bin`, just do this:

    docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/nsenter

The `jpetazzo/nsenter` container will detect that `/target` is a
mountpoint, and it will copy the `nsenter` binary into it.

If you don't trust me, and prefer to extract the `nsenter` binary,
rather than allowing my container to potentially wreak havoc into
your system's `$PATH`, you can also do this:

    docker run --rm jpetazzo/nsenter cat /nsenter > /tmp/nsenter && chmod +x /tmp/nsenter

Then do whatever you want with the binary in `/tmp/nsenter`.


###  `nsenter` inner workings.

First, figure out the PID of the container you want to enter:

    PID=$(docker inspect --format {{.State.Pid}} <container_name_or_ID>)

Then enter the container:

    nsenter --target $PID --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid


### What's that docker-enter thing?

It's just a small shell script that wraps up the steps described above into
a tiny helper. It takes the name or ID of a container and optionally the name
of a program to execute inside the namespace. If no command is specified a
shell will be invoked instead.
  `NOTE:` you have to be root to use it this way. 

    # list the root filesystem
    docker-enter my_awesome_container ls -la


If you want to expose container ports through the host, see the [exposing ports](https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet#exposing-ports) section.

### Info

* [`docker ps`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#ps) shows running containers.
* [`docker inspect`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#inspect) looks at all the info on a container (including IP address).
* [`docker logs`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#logs) gets logs from container.
* [`docker events`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#events) gets events from container.
* [`docker port`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#port) shows public facing port of container.
* [`docker top`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#top) shows running processes in container.
* [`docker diff`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#diff) shows changed files in the container's FS.

`docker ps -a` shows running and stopped containers.

### Import / Export

There doesn't seem to be a way to use docker directly to import files into a container's filesystem.  The closest thing is to mount a host file or directory as a data volume and copy it from inside the container.

* [`docker cp`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#cp) copies files or folders out of a container's filesystem.
* [`docker export`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#export) turns container filesystem into tarball.


### Images

Images are just [templates for docker containers](http://docker.readthedocs.org/reference/terms/image/).



Docker.io hosts its own [index](https://index.docker.io/) to a central registry which contains a large number of repositories.

* [`docker login`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#login) to login to a registry.
* [`docker search`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#search) searches registry for image.
* [`docker pull`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#pull) pulls an image from registry to local machine.
* [`docker push`](http://docs.docker.io/reference/commandline/cli/#push) pushes an image to the registry from local machine.

### Dockerfile

[The configuration file](http://docs.docker.io/introduction/working-with-docker/#working-with-the-dockerfile). Sets up a Docker container when you run `docker build` on it.  Vastly preferable to `docker commit`.

### Best Practices

Best to look at [http://github.com/wsargent/docker-devenv](http://github.com/wsargent/docker-devenv) and the [best practices](http://crosbymichael.com/dockerfile-best-practices.html) / [take 2](http://crosbymichael.com/dockerfile-best-practices-take-2.html) for more details.

If you use [jEdit](http://jedit.org), I've put up a syntax highlighting module for [Dockerfile](https://github.com/wsargent/jedit-docker-mode) you can use.

## Layers

The [versioned filesystem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs) in Docker is based on layers.  They're like [git commits or changesets for filesystems](http://docker.readthedocs.org/reference/terms/layer/).

## Links

Links are how Docker containers talk to each other [through TCP/IP ports](http://docs.docker.io/use/working_with_links_names/).  [Linking into Redis](http://docs.docker.io/use/working_with_links_names/#links-service-discovery-for-docker) and [Atlassian](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/11/docker-all-the-things-at-atlassian-automation-and-wiring/) show worked examples.  You can also (in 0.11) resolve [links by hostname](http://docs.docker.io/use/working_with_links_names/#resolving-links-by-name).

NOTE: If you want containers to ONLY communicate with each other through links, start the docker daemon with `-icc=false` to disable inter process communication.

If you have a container with the name CONTAINER (specified by `docker run --name CONTAINER`) and in the Dockerfile, it has an exposed port:

```
EXPOSE 1337
```

Then if we create another container called LINKED like so:

```
docker run -d --link CONTAINER:ALIAS --name LINKED user/wordpress
```

Then the exposed ports and aliases of CONTAINER will show up in LINKED with the following environment variables:

```
$ALIAS_PORT_1337_TCP_PORT
$ALIAS_PORT_1337_TCP_ADDR
```

And you can connect to it that way.

To delete links, use `docker rm --link `.

## Volumes

Docker volumes are [free-floating filesystems](http://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/).  They don't have to be connected to a particular container.

Volumes are useful in situations where you can't use links (which are TCP/IP only).  For instance, if you need to have two docker instances communicate by leaving stuff on the filesystem.

You can mount them in several docker containers at once, using `docker run -volume-from`

Because volumes are isolated filesystems, they are often used to store state from computations between transient containers.  That is, you can have a stateless and transient container run from a recipe, blow it away, and then have a second instance of the transient container pick up from where the last one left off.

See [advanced volumes](http://crosbymichael.com/advanced-docker-volumes.html) for more details.

## Exposing ports

Exposing ports through the host container is [fiddly but doable](http://docs.docker.io/use/port_redirection/#binding-a-port-to-an-host-interface).

First expose the port in your Dockerfile:

```
EXPOSE <CONTAINERPORT>
```

Then map the container port to the host port (only using localhost interface):

```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:$HOSTPORT:$CONTAINERPORT --name CONTAINER -t someimage
```

If you're running Docker in Virtualbox, you then need to forward the port there as well.  It can be useful to define something in Vagrantfile to expose a range of ports so that you can dynamically map them:

```
Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
  ...

  (49000..49900).each do |port|
    config.vm.network :forwarded_port, :host => port, :guest => port
  end

  ...
end
```

If you forget what you mapped the port to on the host container, use `docker port` to show it:

```
docker port CONTAINER $CONTAINERPORT
```
